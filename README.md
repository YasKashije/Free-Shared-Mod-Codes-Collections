# All Are Free Share Mod Products Codes Collections
The collections of game mod products source codes and offsets =D
 
Here I will share my offsets, source codes and function names so you can learn and see how I wrote the code, and get ideas. Most codes are very old back to 2014, mostly from dead/abandoned/server closed games. Not all codes are modding tho, some of them are just notes, sources may look messy. Some sources are from public with proper credits given. I know this repo is obviously a spoonfeeder but... why not share when it's no longer secret? XD

And also, it's to stop leechers from leeching my offsets when it's impossible to stop them. Now they can just find this straight forward without leeching hehe. I'll try to share my codes of my active mods when i can, but at the same time i don't want devs patching something, maybe i'll do only if idc about specific games

I have turned off issues, because i don't read it often and don't want spam links and noobs asking how to use it.

I'll appreciate if you can credit to me and others (if mentioned) at least

Have fun :)
